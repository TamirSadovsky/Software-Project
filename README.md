# Software-Project
Community Structure in Networks
TAU Software Project Course - Final Project 


In this project, an algorithm for detecting community structures (or clusters) in a network was applied.

Description:
The ability to detect such groups is of signicant importance. For example, partitioning a protein-protein interaction network into clusters can provide a
modular view of the network, with different groups of nodes performing different functions within the cell.

## :arrow_right: Deployment

There are two arguments passed to the project on the command line. 
Firstly, the input filename, and secondly, the output filename. Networks are input to the program (a graph), and groups are output (the division).
